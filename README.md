#Hello world, 
I am new on github and i am here to make the best out of web development, desktop app deveopments, android app and other IT
stuffs that might interest me. i hope to do projects and contribute to peoples code, share in success stories and have fun coding in a professional manner. i hope this is not an 'impossible' mission because i am here to delete that word and have fun celebrating success on github. Believe me, i already had fun sitting on my computer an typing this stuff, yeah, i have to write something....My github guide instructed i do so and i have to tell you why i am here . So, let's get to work
...................................
i have made my master branch, yeah.....that keyword though. Now i am just updating stuffs, ok....stick with my gibrish, let's ride through this start up mess together and we will smile together or even laugh out loud when we revisit this file in few months to come. i hope you're not watching my grammatical errors...please don't!
